# Services and deployment

| Service | What it does | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare Pages | Main hosting | https://axomrank.pages.dev (project `axomrank`) |
| GitHub Pages | Second copy, built from `main` | https://axomrank.github.io/ |
| Firebase Auth | Google sign-in | Project `axomrank-ahom` |
| Firestore | One progress document per learner, `users/{uid}` (Mumbai, asia-south1) | Project `axomrank-ahom` |

All are on free plans.

## Publishing an update

```bash
python3 scripts/build.py          # check content, write content/manifest.json, stamp sw.js
git add -A ':!nesfic*' && git commit -m "…" && git push   # GitHub Pages
scripts/deploy_cloudflare.sh      # Cloudflare Pages (copies only the website files)
```

The build stamps a new version into `sw.js`, so phones replace old app files on their next visit.

## Firestore security rules

Rules are in `firestore.rules`: each learner can read and write only their own document, with only the fields the app uses (xp, streak, lessons, mistakes, srs, days, stats, checkpoints, updated). To publish changes (uses gcloud):

```bash
scripts/deploy_rules.sh
```

## Firebase settings that live in the console

- **Authentication → Sign-in method:** Google is enabled.
- **Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains:** `axomrank.pages.dev`, `axomrank.github.io` (add a custom domain here when you get one).
- **Web app config:** in `app/config.js`. These values are public by design; the rules protect the data.

## Images on Cloudflare R2 (later)

Images are served with the app (about 2 MB for two lessons). When media grows or audio is added:

1. Cloudflare dashboard → R2 → create a bucket with public access and a CORS rule allowing GET from the two site addresses.
2. Upload `content/media/` to it, keeping the same paths.
3. Set `mediaBase` in `app/config.js` to the bucket's public URL (ending with `/`) and publish.

## Android and iOS (next step)

Wrap the web app with Capacitor. Google Play costs $25 once; the Apple developer account costs $99 per year. Google sign-in inside the native apps needs the `@capacitor-firebase/authentication` plugin.
