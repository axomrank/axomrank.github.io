# Axomrank · Assam government exam preparation

Short, game-like, bilingual (English and Assamese) lessons for ADRE, Assam TET, APSC and Assam Police SI. It works offline and can be installed from the browser.

**Live:** https://axomrank.pages.dev (also https://axomrank.github.io/)

**Courses:** Ahom Kings (41 reigns, 1228–1838) is the first course. More subjects (Assam geography, polity, economy, culture, current affairs, general studies) follow the same lesson format; see `product-plan.md`.

## Adding a lesson

1. Write `content/lessons/<id>.json` (`suteuphaa.json` and `subinphaa.json` are the models), including its `sources`. Give every step a new, unique `id` and never change an id once it is published, because saved progress, review and mistakes refer to it.
   - Unit count follows the king's tier: A = 6–8 units, B = 4–6, C = 2–3. One unit per story beat of the reign.
   - Mark names in text as `[[id]]` or `[[id|shown text]]`; add new names to `content/entities.json`. Learners can tap them.
   - `map`: a `box` [west, south, east, north], the rivers, ridges and places to `show`, and optional `routes`, `texts`, `labels`. Positions are [lat, lon].
2. Put its full-size images (WebP, about 1080 px) in `content/media/<id>/` (or `shared/`). The build script makes the small `@480` copies.
3. Set `"lesson": "<id>"` on the king in `content/courses/ahom-kings.json`, and add exam questions for its era to `content/questions/ahom.json`.
4. Run `python3 scripts/build.py`, then deploy (`git push` for GitHub Pages, or `scripts/deploy_cloudflare.sh`).

## Lesson design: never boring

The app must feel like a game, not a textbook: short units, a story first, a different kind of exercise every time, instant feedback with the reason, and visible progress on one path through the whole course. Anything repetitive or dull is a bug.

- **Units:** one story beat each: 2–3 short story cards (with a painting, map or art), then 5–7 exercises.
- **Exercise mix:** prefer whoami, map, timeline, picture, tf, unscramble, spot, fill, match, order, odd. Use plain `mcq` rarely (at most one exam-style "consider the statements" question in a lesson test). Pick the type that fits the fact: place → map, date → timeline, person → whoami, scene → picture, trap → tf or spot.
- **Every unit:** 4 `learned` points; links (`link`) to earlier units or lessons where the story really connects.

Exercise types: story, mcq, tf, inline, fill, match, order, unscramble, odd, picture, whoami, spot, timeline, map.

## Learning loop (in `app/engine.js`, not in the lesson data)

- In a unit or lesson test, a missed question comes back **once** at the end. Matching exercises do not repeat.
- Test-outs, "Jump here" tests and era checkpoints never repeat questions; the 80% pass mark counts first attempts.
- Missed questions are saved to the lesson's mistakes list ("Practise your mistakes") and to the daily review (1, 3, 7, 15, 30 days).
- Passing a lesson test (80%+) opens Unit 1 of the next lesson. A locked lesson keeps its units locked; its last circle is "Jump here".
- Every lesson page shows the whole course as one path, scrolled to the open lesson.

Add `?all` to the course home or a lesson to unlock everything for review.

## Story cards: the one design

Every story card is built the same way, by the engine, so a lesson author only writes text and picks a picture.

**Layout, top to bottom**
1. **Kicker**: "STORY", with one progress dot per paragraph on the right.
2. **Hero**: an AHOM painting (or the lesson map, or line art). If the card mentions a year, the first year appears as a terra stamp on the painting.
3. **Title**: at most 6 words, a hook rather than a label ("Blood on the forehead", not "Phuleswari's Durga Puja").
4. **Lede**: the first paragraph, larger. It must make sense alone.
5. **Beats**: each further paragraph appears on the next tap, with a left rule, so the reader never faces a wall of text. Continue reveals the next beat before moving on.

**Word limits (the build fails if broken)**
- At most 3 paragraphs, 35 words per paragraph, 55 words per card (counted in English).
- One idea per paragraph; if a card needs more, split it into two cards.

**Emphasis: three kinds, never mixed**
- `<mark>` = **the key fact** to remember. A gold highlighter sweeps across it as the beat appears. At most 3 per card.
- `[[entity]]` = **a name you can tap** for its meaning. Shown with a dotted underline, never highlighted.
- **Years** are styled automatically (bold terra), so do not mark a year only to make it stand out.
- `<b>` = plain bold, for lists of names and the letters of a memory trick. On "Remember …" cards each `<b>` letter becomes a round terra badge.
